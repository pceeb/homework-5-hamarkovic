#(get raw data from user, combine csv into a single table and add a row to the left storing file name (ID)):
#have the user put all their files into the empty RIDGE_INPUT folder before starting the program

#in bash:
#loop through each file in the folder
#   for each file, add a column to the left
#   remove the ".csv" from the end of the file name
#   add this edited name into every row of the first column
#concatenate vertically all of the files

#in R:
#input the concatenated data

#(turn raw data (representing boundaries) into points that represent the center of the microridge)
#(eventually, I would like to use an alogrithm for this, but for now I will use the average between points:)

#create list to store average curviness of each ridge of the cell
#create list to store curviness of each microridge
#loop through each ridge of the cell, and for each ridge:
#   create variables to store ridge length and curviness
#   for i in (number of points in the ridge)
#       compute average between adjacent points
#       add this average as a new column in the data file/table
#   add distance between average points to get ridge length
#   create list to store curviness values for each point in the ridge
#   compute curviness of the ridge using the average points and length (derivatives formula)
#       this will be a for loop, because using instantaneous derivatives
#       store instantaneous curviness value in the list
#   add curviness values in the list and divide by ridge length to get curviness over the ridge
#   store curviness of the ridge in another column of the data file
#   store curviness of the ridge in a new summary csv file, with the cell number/ID in the first column, ridge ID in the second column, ridge length in the third column, and curviness value in the fourth column

#compute and store average of all microridges in the cell
#store cell average in a super summary file which has cell ID in the first column and average curviness over the cell in the second column

#output original data file with curviness values for each ridge
#output summary file with average curviness value for each cell
#output super summary file with cell ID and average curviness for each cell
